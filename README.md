# LagRemoval
EntityClearingMod 1.18.2 Forge

Credit too (SWDTeam's) 1.18.1 Code of there Lag-Removal.

This is a handbuilt fork of it to work for 1.18.2; If you have the know how to using this then feel free, however, this is just a private project. 

A potential goal in the future is to make an overall facy clear lag like mod with a set of robust tools. TBD

I will provide releases of this single mod here for those who want just this as a standalone mod.
Information on ServerTality is yet to be released or public, it's currently under review from community leaders on if to make it published when it's completed.
