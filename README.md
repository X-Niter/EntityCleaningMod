# LagRemoval
EntityClearingMod 1.18.2 Forge

Credit too (SWDTeam's) for the idea back in 1.16.

Though stated the idea from source of SWDTeam, keep in mind there is no repo for there actual mod, therfor everything here is simply a clean effort to make a system exactly the same, however, this is not even close to theres.
Though it may run the same, this whole repo is a huge reconstruction of how they managed the feature, this repo includes more options, commands, ability, and finer controls.

Though it's far from finished, this is not any project expected to be a publishment, but ony an open accesible project to whom it concerns.

There is a laundry list of how this mod works that I expect to change, filtered configurations to add, and so on. 
This however is mainly here for the purpose of getting into 1.16.5's Forge methods of messing with different types of entities and messing with chunk collection on how to make the system more indepth.

My actuall planned project behind this is getting the understanding and commfort and then taking on a whole overhaul Server Admin like mod utilizing overglorified tools to keep things maintained while you have to be away from your server.

A potential goal in the future is to make an overall facy clear lag like mod with a set of robust tools. TBD

I will provide releases of this single mod here for those who want just this as a standalone mod.
Information on ServerTality is yet to be released or public, it's currently under review from community leaders on if to make it published when it's completed.
